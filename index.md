## about me

Huon Wilson (that's me) is a university student in Australia. I try to
write neat code and do neat mathematics, and occasionally appear in
episodes of the Internet such as:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/huonw)
- the [StackExchange](http://stackexchange.com/users/1308075/dbaupp)
  network (mostly
  [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1256624/dbaupp) and
  [Mathematics](http://math.stackexchange.com/users/26567/dbaupp)),
  and
- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dbaupp)

## things done

### programming
- **[Contributions](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/commits?author=huonw)**
  to [Mozilla's Rust language](https://github.com/mozilla/rust).
- **[word explorer](http://www.ug.it.usyd.edu.au/~hwil7821/assignment3/form.html)**,
  because if you are going to do a university assignment, you might as
  well do a hyperbolic graph.
- [Crossworder](https://github.com/huonw/crossworder), because
  formatting crosswords by hand sucks.
- The [front-end work](https://github.com/huonw/huonw.github.io) for this site.
- [Miscellaneous web tidbits](http://www.ug.it.usyd.edu.au/~hwil7821/).

    physics and chemistry
