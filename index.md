## things done

### programming
Here's some things I've written, or at least, been involved with. They are mostly either Python, PHP or CSS/HTML/JavaScript (or some combination of that).

- **[Crossworder](https://github.com/dbaupp/crossworder)**, because formatting crosswords by hand sucks.
- **[word explorer](http://www.ug.it.usyd.edu.au/~hwil7821/assignment3/form.html)**, because if you are
  going to do a university assignment, you might as well do a hyperbolic graph.
- [Modifications](https://github.com/dbaupp/melville-facing-the-singularity-edition) to the
  [Melville](http://madebyraygun.com/wordpress/themes/melville/) WordPress theme for use on
  [Facing&shy;The&shy;Singularity.com](http://facingthesingularity.com/)
- Minor [contributions](https://github.com/dbaupp/lesswrong) to the [LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/)
  [code base](https://github.com/tricycle/lesswrong). (Oh, also, I'm
  [dbaupp](http://lesswrong.com/user/dbaupp) there too)
