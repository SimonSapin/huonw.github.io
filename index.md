You've found Huon Wilson's site. Evidently, this is mostly empty at the moment. It might have stuff
at some point, but there's not really any reason for it to be public at all, at the moment.


## things done
Here's some stuff that I've done.

### coding

- Small [modifications](https://github.com/dbaupp/melville-facing-the-singularity-edition) to the
  [Melville](http://madebyraygun.com/wordpress/themes/melville/) WordPress theme for use on
  [Facing&shy;The&shy;Singularity.com](http://facingthesingularity.com/)
- Minor [contributions](https://github.com/dbaupp/lesswrong) to the [LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/)
  [code base](https://github.com/tricycle/lesswrong). (Oh, also, I'm
  [dbaupp](http://lesswrong.com/user/dbaupp) there too)
- [Crossworder](https://github.com/dbaupp/crossworder), because formatting crosswords by hand sucks.
- [word explorer](http://www.ug.it.usyd.edu.au/~hwil7821/assignment3/form.html), because if you are
  going to do a university assignment, you might as well do a hyperbolic graph. (At the time of
  writing, it has reduced functionality, since the web server is running python 2.2, and the backend
  needs python 2.6+)

### not coding
- [Notes](notes.html) for [HSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_School_Certificate_%28New_South_Wales%29) physics and chemistry
