## about me

Huon Wilson (that's me) is a university student in Australia. I try to write neat code and do neat mathematics, and occasionally appear in episodes of the Internet such as:

- the [StackExchange](http://stackexchange.com/users/1308075/dbaupp) network (mostly [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1256624/dbaupp) and [Mathematics](http://math.stackexchange.com/users/26567/dbaupp)),
- [LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/user/dbaupp), and
- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dbaupp)


## things done

### programming

- **[Crossworder](https://github.com/dbaupp/crossworder)**, because formatting crosswords by hand sucks.
- **[word explorer](http://www.ug.it.usyd.edu.au/~hwil7821/assignment3/form.html)**, because if you are
  going to do a university assignment, you might as well do a hyperbolic graph.
- Minor (but increasingly less so)
  [contributions](https://github.com/dbaupp/rust) to
  [Mozilla's Rust language](https://github.com/mozilla/rust).
- [Modifications](https://github.com/dbaupp/melville-facing-the-singularity-edition) to the
  [Melville](http://madebyraygun.com/wordpress/themes/melville/) WordPress theme for use on
  [FacingTheSingularity.com](http://facingthesingularity.com/)
- Minor [contribution(s)](https://github.com/dbaupp/lesswrong) to the [LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/)
  [code base](https://github.com/tricycle/lesswrong).
- The [front-end work](https://github.com/dbaupp/dbaupp.github.com) for this site.
