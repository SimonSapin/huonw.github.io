This site uses CSS `@media` directives to render the page nicer for different screen formats. Try changing your browser window.

If the window is very wide, the text is allowed to take up more room, and some elements become multicolumn (only lists at the moment). If it's very thin (or being viewed by a mobile browser), then the amount of whitespace is reduced.

If a page is being printed, then many elements are removed (such as the "valid html" text in the bottom left) to reduce the amount of clutter on the printed page.
