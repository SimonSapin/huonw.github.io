Yep. Definitely the first one.

And this is the second one. Well, second paragraph. But it has more text in it, which is a bit exciting.

## First subtitle
### Subsubtitle
#### (Sub){3}title

Blah!

##### Level 5 subtitle
###### Sub&times;3!&ndash;title
This isn't a subtitle. It's just normal text.

### Subsubtitle2

Imagine if I had another subtitle.

#### Subsubsubtitle

Blah-dee-blah. The formatting seems to works.
