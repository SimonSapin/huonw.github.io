If you're here, I'm guessing you're part way through year 12 in NSW,
and are probably not enjoying it too much, and maybe even trying to
learn some stuff for the little quiz at the end of the year, before
you move on to bigger and better things.
           
Notes are always a good way of learning, whether by reading their
distilled information, or by actually writing them yourself. The
latter method (I find) is the best way of learning material, so I
wrote some notes for physics and chemistry when I was doing my
[HSC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_School_Certificate_(New_South_Wales))
in 2010.

Not only did I write them, I wrote them electronically, so, by the
magic of the internet, you can have them as well. For free. No
cost. Without payment. Etc etc. (Also, speaking of altruism, maybe you
could direct your friends here, too)

Maybe they'll help you too, maybe not.

## details
                  
I went (fairly carefully, although not 100%) through the syllabi
([physics](http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/syllabus_hsc/physics.html)
&
[chemistry](http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/syllabus_hsc/chemistry.html)),
just to make sure I "knew" everything, so maybe you could use these
for that purpose (I *strongly* recommend against them being
your first reference).

Some technical details, I did the <i>Industrial Chemistry</i> and the
<i>From Quanta To Quarks</i> options, so they are the only ones
covered; and very few of the practicals listed in the syllabus are
even mentioned (that means that these *cannot* be your only
source of information).
